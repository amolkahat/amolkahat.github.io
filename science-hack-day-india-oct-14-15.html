        <p>On October 14-15 Science Hack Day (SHD) was organized in <strong>Sankalp Bhumi, Balgvai, Karnataka, India.</strong> This was the second SHD in India, Before that, it happened on same place a year back, And this was my First SHD event.</p>
<p>At the beginning, I wondering the what I'm going to do in the SHD, what I do I'll explain later. But when I got there I fall in love with the venue. The venue was very awesome, lake view, guest house, and that chair in the balcony from where I was scanning the all the venue.</p>
<p>From Pune we (Sayan, Akshay, Saptak, Medu, and Amritesh) caught the train for the Belgavi, 13th morning we reach there, and of course, Prof. Pravin Patil and Suyash was there to pick us up. When we reach the venue we met with Farhan who also first time attending the SHD India.</p>
<p>That whole day we were busy with meeting the people and doing some other activities, like we done rafting on the lake, cycling on the venue, etc, etc.. In the evening we gather together and started out introduction, <a href="https://twitter.com/hiteshnd">Hitesh</a> is one of the organizers of the SHD India, form itself he started the introduction and then one by one other people started the introduction. He is also security guy who is interested in cyber security/Hacing etc.</p>
<!--more-->

<p>On the 14 we wake up and had a breakfast. And gather in the conference hall, that hall was full of the school students, some people who came as a hacker and mentor were there. So after the introduction, we presented our ideas, what we are going to do in the SHD. After the introduction of the mentors we get the best presentation on Aeromodelling, Speaker explained 10 main parts of the plain. You can see me holding the plane in some <a href="https://twitter.com/shd_india">tweets</a>. That was a very best session because we were learning from the expert. I have some interest in the flying the planes or designing it so it was very informative to me. After that session speaker shows us how the play fly.</p>
<p>We came to the cafeteria and started with the 3D printer and 3D pen. I was there for every event, I was helping for setting up the 3D printer, I was helping to Nisha for 3D pen drawing etc.</p>
<p>At the evening some lighting talks were scheduled, so we all gather in the cafeteria. The first talk was stared by Sayan about the Pycon Pune, then Farhan, he was talking about the creating the games etc., there was one talk about the Silicon wafer, Amol Sir who was presenting the talk and telling us how this Silicon wafer made. Then Gautam Samant talking about the physics behind the bicycle and at last Hitesh was talking about the RAT (Remote Access Trojans).</p>
<p>At the evening after the dinner, we gather in the cafeteria for the hacking. We were working on our own laptops. Siddhesh, Sayan, Saptak, Akshay was busy in setting up their 3D printer, and finally, the printer is up and running.</p>
<p>On the next day, everyone started to complete their hacking idea, I was trying to build one Fedora logo with the LEDs. So it previously designed by someone I started to repair it. And it was up and running. Only two LEDs are not glowing. So that day i got best advice form <a href="https://twitter.com/shakthimaan">Shakti Kannan</a> hardware and software and I <a href="https://twitter.com/Amolkahat/status/921229485734633472">tweeted</a> it.</p>
<p>On that day different events were going on like soldering workshop, Dome building, 3D printer running, etc. I was wondering to see what people were doing and talking to them.</p>
<p>And the finally at the evening Pravin Patil with the students started to fly the Rockets. And at the end of the day which was actually the end of the event we all gather in to the hall, and Hitesh was speking what people have done in that two days, and the hackers were there with their designed ideas.</p>
<p>It was really nice event, and I'm waiting to join it again in next year. Till then try to hack the things. :)</p>
